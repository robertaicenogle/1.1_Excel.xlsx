# An Analysis of Kickstarter Campaigns

## Overview of Project
The following project is an analysis of fundraiser data using the Excel program. The project includes three major devilerables. An analysis of outcomes based on launch date (included in Excel doc), which primarily used pivot tables. An analysis of outcomes based on goals (also in Excel doc), which utilized various functions, such as COUNTIFS(). The third devilable is the written explanation contained in this readme.

### Purpose
Louise came close to reaching her fundraising goal for her play, Fever, in a relatively short period of time. Now, she's interested in learning how other fundraising campaigns fared in relation to launch date and fundraising goals. The purpose of this project is to carry out an analysis of various other fundraising campaigns, in order to provide insight to Louise.

## Analysis and Challenges
The following is an an analysis of the two deliverables, and a discussion of the challenges I faced in completing this project.

### Deliverable 1: Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date

Explain how you performed your analysis using images and links to code, as well as any challenges you encountered and how you overcame them. If you had no challenges, describe any possible challenges or difficulties that could be encountered.

## Results
The following are results drawn from Deliverable one (Outcomes vs Launch Date) and Deliverable two (Outcomes based on Goals).

#### Conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?

### Conclusions based on Outcomes based on Goals?

The success and failure of a goal are inversely correlated. Campaigns which had a lower goal were more likely to succeed. Those with goals under $5,000. Generally, the higher the goal, the more likely the campaign was to fail.

- What are some limitations of this dataset?

- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
There is a summary of the limitations of the dataset, and there is a recommendation for additional tables or graphs.
