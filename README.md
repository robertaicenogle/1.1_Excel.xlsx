# An Analysis of Kickstarter Campaigns

## Overview of Project
The following project is an analysis of fundraiser data using the Excel program. The project includes three major devilerables. An analysis of outcomes based on launch date (included in Excel doc), which primarily used pivot tables. An analysis of outcomes based on goals (also in Excel doc), which utilized various functions, such as COUNTIFS(). The third devilable is the written explanation contained in this readme.

### Purpose
Louise came close to reaching her fundraising goal for her play, Fever, in a relatively short period of time. Now, she's interested in learning how other fundraising campaigns fared in relation to launch date and fundraising goals. The purpose of this project is to carry out an analysis of various other fundraising campaigns, in order to provide insight to Louise.

## Analysis and Challenges
The following is an an analysis of the two deliverables, and a discussion of the challenges I faced in completing this project.

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date
